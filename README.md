## The best Chinese cheat sheet（Cheatsheet）

When I was learning Linux, I relied on a small card of commonly used commands. I forgot what command I typed. Look up the table. For many tools, reading books and voluminous articles is too time-consuming. In fact, most of the time, you only need a small form.

Recently, I was inspired by LeCoupa’s [LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets](https://github.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets) project. I felt that the online Chinese materials were scarce and the quality was uneven, so I decided to make a Chinese cheatsheet. Project, collect and organize commonly used Cheatsheets of programming languages, frameworks and development tools. The number is not high, but each table must be done thoroughly, so that you don't need to search for articles on the Internet aimlessly, a simple cheatsheet file will completely satisfy you.
